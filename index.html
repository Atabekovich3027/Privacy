            <p>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about
                how to <br> get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to
                build a Figma plugin <br> for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost
                UXWriter and has a set of UX copies <br>cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone
                variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The <br>intention to build this Figma plugin
                originated from our Medium blog post, ‚ÄòDesigning voice and tone for <br> error messages.</p>
